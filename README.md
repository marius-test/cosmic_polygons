# cosmic_polygons

A retro-inspired 3D space shooter built in **Godot Engine 4** - my first 3D Godot project, created to get familiar with 3D game development in the engine. This is a concept videogame developed as part of my learning journey.

You pilot a spaceship navigating through space while shooting incoming low-poly asteroids. The game simulates forward movement as asteroids approach. Avoid collisions or youâ€™ll explode; shoot asteroids to destroy them with retro-style explosions and sound effects.

### To implement

- Score counter  
- Menu to start and quit the game
